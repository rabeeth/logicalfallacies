			<h4>Definition: The genetic fallacy (also known as the fallacy of origins or fallacy of virtue) is a fallacy of irrelevance where a conclusion is suggested based solely on someone's or something's history, origin, or source rather than its current meaning or context.</h4>
			
			<h4>Summary:  A genetic fallacy is yet another simple to comprehend misconception. I think of it as almost being similar to judging a book by it’s cover, although the judgement is based off of prior positive or negative experiences, or context about a particular subject, like: “(News network) says (Y) is true, (News network) is an unreliable source, therefore (Y) is not necessarily true.” It is an argument that lacks relevance.</h4>
			
			<h2>Examples:</h2>
			
			
			<h4>

			“America will never settle down; look at the rabble-rousers who founded it.”
			<br/><br/>
			"You're not going to wear a wedding ring, are you? Don't you know that the wedding ring originally symbolized ankle chains worn by women to prevent them from running away from their husbands? I would not have thought you would be a party to such a sexist practice."
