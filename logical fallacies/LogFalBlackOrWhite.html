			<h4>Definition: False Dilemma. (also known as: all-or-nothing fallacy, false dichotomy, the either-or fallacy, either-or reasoning, fallacy of false choice, fallacy of false alternatives, black-and-white thinking, the fallacy of exhaustive hypotheses, bifurcation, excluded middle, no middle ground, polarization)</h4>
		
			<h4>Summary: Black or White ,also know as False Dilemma, is very simple. Most people should know the term black or white thinking; it’s categorized with the thought that it has to be either/or with no gray areas, though in most cases this proves to be untrue. This fallacy is usually used to make you pick a side. For example: “You're either with me or you’re with the enemy.” In most cases you have at least one more option, for example your stance could be neutral. There are cases where Black or White proves to be true, like: “You’re either with me or not with me.” It’s a small change in the words but it makes the statement true.</h4><br/>

 				The list goes on.
