			<h4>Definition:   The no true scotsman fallacy is a way of reinterpreting evidence in order to prevent the refutation of one's position. Proposed counter-examples to a theory are dismissed as irrelevant solely because they are counter-examples, but purportedly because they are not what the theory is about.</h4>
			
			<h4>Summary: No true scotsman is quite simple and it’s used everyday. It can pop up at any time but it is not a valid argument. When someone makes a valid claim you need to find a different way to refute it than: “Well, no true _____ would _____.” It does not change the facts and you can not change the criteria of a specific group by saying this simple line. Putting it in a more drastic light, it’s like saying:</h4>
			
			<h5>
			Person A: “Nazis aren’t bad!”<br/>
			Person B: “But Nazis killed and imprisoned around 7 million people…”<br/>
			Person A: “Well a true Nazi would never hurt someone!”<br/>
			Not a very solid arrangement is it?<br/>
			</h5>
			
			
			<h4>
				Person A: “I’m a huge fan of the _______ series!”<br/>
				Person B: “Well do you know ____’s favorite food?”<br/>
				Person A: “No?”<br/>
				Person B: “Then you’re not a true fan, all true fans would know.”<br/>
				<br/><br/>
				Person A: All volunteer workers are great people.<br/>
				Person B: Clearly, not all volunteer workers are great people! Some volunteer workers have to volunteer because they violated the law.<br/>
				Person C: But all true volunteer workers are great people.<br/>
				<br/><br/><br/>
				Keep in mind there are cases that this kind of saying would prove true like, “No true honest person would lie.” This only works if there is a clear and well understood definition of the criteria for a group, and that definition is broken.<br/>
